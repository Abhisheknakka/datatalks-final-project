Very moist and the banana is definately the strongest flavor coming from the cake. Will definately make again."

There were a lot of steps, which isn't necessarily a  bad thing, but it didn't fall together like most cake recipes.  For example, I couldn't figure out why I had to melt the butter (and of course cool it) when I was just creaming it, or why add the sugar in two parts.   I had tons of tunnels.  And it would be helpful if there was a number for how long to bake.  At least a range, especially for us novice cooks.   It took 45 minutes for me."
