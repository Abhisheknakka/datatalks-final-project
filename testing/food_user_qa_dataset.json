There were a lot of steps, which isn't necessarily a  bad thing, but it didn't fall together like most cake recipes.  For example, I couldn't figure out why I had to melt the butter (and of course cool it) when I was just creaming it, or why add the sugar in two parts.   I had tons of tunnels.  And it would be helpful if there was a number for how long to bake.  At least a range, especially for us novice cooks.   It took 45 minutes for me."

I did have to add about 1/2 C. of milk to thin, as the batter was too thick to scoop. But with that only addition, they were super! Very high-rising and light and fluffy. DH gave them 5 stars. They were delicious with Louisiana cane syrup. Thanks so much for sharing, CeeDee! "

I can't believe it is so moist and it doesn't even need frosting, the confectioners sugar is exactly right.  I was very skeptical at first, and even when I popped it in the oven, I thought \"I'm gonna end up throwing this out\".  Not a chance!  My DH HATES Beets, and I'm gonna trick him into trying this cake.  I know he's gonna gobble it up!!!  Thanks RitaL for adopting this fabulous recipe!"

Someone even said that it was impressive enough to be entered into a state fair (not that any of us had ever been to one). I watched as everyone savored every bite. It's moist, flavorful, rich, and has a great texture. I'm not a fan of nuts in baked goods, so I left them out. Raisins might be a nice addition as well. I baked it in 2 round nine-inch pans and set the timer for 30 minutes but kept it in longer until it was golden brown. It would be great without icing, but I HAD to top it off with homemade cream cheese icing. This is a keeper and although I'd like to claim this recipe as my own, I have no problem giving credit to Jane Graham, Ann Arber, and RecipeZaar. Thanks for sharing this great recipe!"

I feel that the handle was to thick for the needed results. The Crochet needle like recomended would of been right.\r\nThe next time I make this, I will add some cinnamon in the Butter Sauce. I believe that would really set the cake off. Thank you \r\n"

I wished while I was baking this cake that I were a spoon or bowl in which the ingredients were mixed by me to make it.\r\nI used 1 cup (minus 1 tbsp) of Fresh milk and added 1 tbsp of lemon juice instead of the buttermilk. Rest of the things I have stuck to this recipe. It's a very nice cake and quite easy too. The fact that it is eggless makes it all the more nice as many people I know don't have eggs at all, hence, I have many more soon going to be \"lovers\" of this cake! I'd say that if your depressed or low, request mom to make this for u if u love cakes n chocolate - Just put in 1 piece  of cake and watch your depression run away for miles from you:) Last but not the least, I loved the deep dark brown colour of the cake when done. I garnished it with some chopped almonds and maraschino cherries that made it look all the more yummy and mouth watering and oh well, my stomach says \"Give me more of Depression Fudge cake now and NOW means NOWWWWWW\"!!!:)"

I made this cake for my father's birthday yesterday and it could easily be the best tasting cake I have ever prepared!!  I substituted butter for the shortening and eliminated the filling altogether, using frosting between the layers. To do this, I did not have to make extra frosting, there was plenty. One  bite and I knew I this recipe would quickly become one of my favorites to make over and over again!  The cake is light and delicious, the frosting is scrumptious! Thanks, MG, for making my father's birthday a success!"

My family isn't as crazy for nuts in their cakes and that was the only complaint, but that was a personal thing.  I thought the nuts were good.  What do they know?  Thank you for sharing this recipe.  I will make it again in the future.  (a boring nutless one for my husband and children and then the good nut filled kind for me!!!)"

I actually forgot to put the mini chocolate chips on top, but I don't think anyone minded. It disappeared quickly and I received many compliments and requests for the recipe. And I thought it was relatively easy to make, since it uses store-bought cookie dough. Thanks, Erin, for sharing this recipe. :-)"

In the cake, I replaced a bit of the flour with oats to add more fiber; for the filling, I used cream cheese instead of butter b/c I was runing low on butter but high on the cream cheese (turned out perfectly); used toasted almonds in the filling, added raisins to the cake, and put my new spice that I received from miller in also (cardamom) as I did not have all the spices. I also used 1 egg istead of just the egg whites. I will definantly be making this in the future!! thanks a lot Mirj!! "

          "text": "Review for kartoshnik    potato cake: My husband and I had two couples over for a fried Pickerel dinner this evening and I wanted to have a potato dish to go along with it that I could do ahead of time since I would be busy frying up the fish. I prepared the dish making one change. I used only cheddar cheese in the recipe and it was a mild one. I didn''t want anything to strong as I wanted the fish to be the main focus of the meal. I had the potato mixture all ready a couple of hours before dinner then just before baking I added the baking powder to mixture and got it into the oven. It rises beautifully, and looks nice, and tastes really light and airy. This recipe is certainly a keeper. My other side dishes were honey glazed carrots and a wild rice casserole with mushrooms and slivered almonds.\r\nDoes anybody know the national origin of this dish?  Is it Polish,  Ukrainian or maybe Russian?"

My DH said that this cake tasted just like banana bread.  \r\nI did add the frosting to it, and I loved the flavor it added.  The next time, (can you tell I am already planning on the next time?  LOL!)I will add some cream cheese to the frosting.  \r\nMmmmmm Banana cake with cream cheese frosting.  \r\nThank you for the excellent recipe Lennie.  I can't believe no one has made this before.  It is so easy and moist.  It took me less than 5 minutes to get this into the oven.  You can't beat that.  Thank you!!!!!!!!!"

The coconut extract is just what the recipe needs to give it the coconut flavor; not just the coconut texture with a bit of flavor.  I absolutely loved the idea of the syrup on the cake rather than a glaze.  At first I thought it would make the cake very sweet but the syrup on the cake is actually less sweet than a glaze.  The syrup adds to the moistness of the cake and provides a different twist from a traditional glaze.\r\nI used butter rather than oleo just because I prefer to bake with butter and did not use the rum extract because I didn't have any on hand(also not a big rum fan so I'm not sure if I'd like it).  The one thing I needed was a pastry brush to brush on the glaze.  It was a little difficult trying to drizzle it to get the same effect as a brush.  The recipe doesn't call for it but, I'm probably going to keep the cake in the refrigerator as the moistness may cause the cake to mold quickly.  This recipe is definitely a keeper!"

I just got an email that my Junior's cheesecake recipe was just deleted off the site because there is a similar one listed....here it is.  I am sad to see you have not made it yourself.   I made this for Thanksgiving at my parents house last year.  The only other dessert that was touched out of 8 desserts was the pumpkin pie and that was by me, I had to have a slice...everyone else ate the cheesecake.  Everyone there begged me for the recipe.  Imagine that, a gaggle of jewish grandmothers asking the 29 year old tattooed mechanic how to make a cheesecake.\r\n\r\nThe most important part of this cheesecake is to let all the ingredients sit out to get to room temperature before you start.  This is VERY IMPORTANT.  Also, do not skip any ingredients if you do not have them (like cream of tartar)  It may not seem important, but the recipe is exact and the instructions are very clear.   I would recommend everyone go out and buy the Junior's cookbook.  "

The cake is moist and flavorful, and of course, the traditional german chocolate frosting is wonderful.  I liked the addition of chocolate chips to the top of the cake (some dropped and floated in the cake when baked) and on top of the frosting.  This cake looks very pretty with all the texture to the frosting and the chocolate chips sprinkled across the top.  The directions were easy to follow though I may have cooked my frosting longer than directed as I was afraid the frosting would be too thin.  I can't wait until I have an opportunity to bring a cake to something as I'd imagine this cake would go over very well (and quickly too).  Definetly a keeper!!"

First, in the cake I did 1/2 cup Irish Cream and 1/4 cup Irish Whiskey.  Second, for the glaze I did 1/8 cup Irish Whiskey and 1/8 cup Godiva Chocolate Liquer.  You really end up only using half the glaze.  Wow, this cake...it has now become my trademark! Thanks Recipenut!"

At first i was going to make a cake from scratch but i ran out of time and ended up choosing this recipe.  This was EASY.  I dumped everything into the mixing bowl and with a hand mixer beat it for about 3 min.  I was not sure about the margarine, so i left it room temp. and cut it into squares so it would be easier to mix in but i did not melt it.  And i only added 1 oz. of red color and about 1/2 a bottle of .25 oz. red color (that was all i had) but the red color was intense just like it should be not pink.  Will also add some vanilla next time just b/c i love it.  Made this in a 13x9 and it took about 26 min. but my oven runs a little hot.  There were a few spots that were yellow where i think the margarine did not get mixed in but i don't think anyone noticed.  Frosted with store bought cream cheese frosting.  Beautiful, moist cake just love the deep red color.  And as simple as it was this will be my stand-by recipe for red velvet cake if i do not have the time to make one from scratch.  \r\nThank you AnnaCG =) "

Very rich and cocoa-ish, with a great, light texture.  I was on a random circuit of gift-giving the weekend I made this, and brought this along to many recipients.  It was adored all around, and I had to give the recipe to a couple of people.  Has gone into my files as my basic chocolate cake.  "

I used yellow cake mix with vanilla pudding and used milk instead of water (just because I always do that with cake mixes).  I glazed it with just a powdered sugar glaze.  Took it out of the oven about 10PM last night.  I went to bed and left my husband and 3 teenage boys alone with the cake.  There is about 3 inches of cake left this morning."

I made this with the intention of using it as a base for other desserts calling for sliced pound cake, but this can stand on its own witha bit of powdered sugar dusted on top. I had no problems preparing this cake.  It makes a large cake and is very versatile - you can vary the flavor slightly by using a different flavor of yogurt.  I used vanilla this time.  It is easy to prepare and turned out great.  It is dense yet tastes light. Thanks! "

I thought Dick's Bakery in San Jose, CA had ruined all other Burnt Almond cakes for me so I was very surprised at how much I enjoyed this one.  I made it for dessert for Christmas and it was enjoyed by all...well, almost all.  A picky sister and a niece who'd rather have ice cream don't count!  Everyone else truly loved it.  I actually used both cakes and just doubled the custard (which was excellent, by the way!).  This cake does take a bit of time to prepare because everything must cool first but it is not difficult with very easy-to-follow instructions.  I highly recommend for people to give this cake a try.  Thanks for posting!"

As a lover of rhubarb, I was drawn to this recipe as it wa similar to my own recipe but the jello and marshmellows were a new feature. I also tried it with sliced strawberries and it also was superb. Since rhubarb can be hard to obtain, this recipes adaptability to other fruits makes it a real plus in my book.  It does require a longer baking time than normal, about 70 minutes but I am at a very high altitude so watch carefully but plan on at least 45 minutes and keep checking."
