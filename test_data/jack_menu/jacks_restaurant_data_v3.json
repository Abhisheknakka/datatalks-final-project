There were a lot of steps, which isn't necessarily a  bad thing, but it didn't fall together like most cake recipes.  For example, I couldn't figure out why I had to melt the butter (and of course cool it) when I was just creaming it, or why add the sugar in two parts.   I had tons of tunnels.  And it would be helpful if there was a number for how long to bake.  At least a range, especially for us novice cooks.   It took 45 minutes for me."

I did have to add about 1/2 C. of milk to thin, as the batter was too thick to scoop. But with that only addition, they were super! Very high-rising and light and fluffy. DH gave them 5 stars. They were delicious with Louisiana cane syrup. Thanks so much for sharing, CeeDee! "

Someone even said that it was impressive enough to be entered into a state fair (not that any of us had ever been to one). I watched as everyone savored every bite. It's moist, flavorful, rich, and has a great texture. I'm not a fan of nuts in baked goods, so I left them out. Raisins might be a nice addition as well. I baked it in 2 round nine-inch pans and set the timer for 30 minutes but kept it in longer until it was golden brown. It would be great without icing, but I HAD to top it off with homemade cream cheese icing. This is a keeper and although I'd like to claim this recipe as my own, I have no problem giving credit to Jane Graham, Ann Arber, and RecipeZaar. Thanks for sharing this great recipe!"

I feel that the handle was to thick for the needed results. The Crochet needle like recomended would of been right.\r\nThe next time I make this, I will add some cinnamon in the Butter Sauce. I believe that would really set the cake off. Thank you \r\n"

It took about 15 mins. to make, and 25 mins in the oven!! \r\nThings I changed were: replaced the egg with flaxmeal, added sliced almonds, added shredded coconut, and used half vanilla extract/half almond extract. I also had to reduce the sugar finding the batter to be a bit too sweet.\r\nThanks for the recipe!!"

Matter of fact, I've been told I can't bake him anything different next year -- LOL. All I did was look for something that was really chocolatey, and made from scratch. The one comment I'd make is that it is very time consuming. It's definitely worthwhile for special occasions, though!"

When I was a child I lived next to a man who was a professional baker and when plums were in season he made something very similar to your recipe and it was my favorite.  I've been wanting it ever since and now I've found it thanks to you. I made it tonight for my Mother's 88th Birthday and it was a five star sensation!!"

I wished while I was baking this cake that I were a spoon or bowl in which the ingredients were mixed by me to make it.\r\nI used 1 cup (minus 1 tbsp) of Fresh milk and added 1 tbsp of lemon juice instead of the buttermilk. Rest of the things I have stuck to this recipe. It's a very nice cake and quite easy too. The fact that it is eggless makes it all the more nice as many people I know don't have eggs at all, hence, I have many more soon going to be \"lovers\" of this cake! I'd say that if your depressed or low, request mom to make this for u if u love cakes n chocolate - Just put in 1 piece  of cake and watch your depression run away for miles from you:) Last but not the least, I loved the deep dark brown colour of the cake when done. I garnished it with some chopped almonds and maraschino cherries that made it look all the more yummy and mouth watering and oh well, my stomach says \"Give me more of Depression Fudge cake now and NOW means NOWWWWWW\"!!!:)"

I made this cake for my father's birthday yesterday and it could easily be the best tasting cake I have ever prepared!!  I substituted butter for the shortening and eliminated the filling altogether, using frosting between the layers. To do this, I did not have to make extra frosting, there was plenty. One  bite and I knew I this recipe would quickly become one of my favorites to make over and over again!  The cake is light and delicious, the frosting is scrumptious!

My family isn't as crazy for nuts in their cakes and that was the only complaint, but that was a personal thing.  I thought the nuts were good.  What do they know?  Thank you for sharing this recipe.  I will make it again in the future.  (a boring nutless one for my husband and children and then the good nut filled kind for me!!!)"

In the cake, I replaced a bit of the flour with oats to add more fiber; for the filling, I used cream cheese instead of butter b/c I was runing low on butter but high on the cream cheese (turned out perfectly); used toasted almonds in the filling, added raisins to the cake, and put my new spice that I received from miller in also (cardamom) as I did not have all the spices. I also used 1 egg istead of just the egg whites. I will definantly be making this in the future!! thanks a lot Mirj!! "

I prepared the dish making one change. I used only cheddar cheese in the recipe and it was a mild one. I didn''t want anything to strong as I wanted the fish to be the main focus of the meal. I had the potato mixture all ready a couple of hours before dinner then just before baking I added the baking powder to mixture and got it into the oven. It rises beautifully, and looks nice, and tastes really light and airy. This recipe is certainly a keeper. My other side dishes were honey glazed carrots and a wild rice casserole with mushrooms and slivered almonds.\r\nDoes anybody know the national origin of this dish?  Is it Polish,  Ukrainian or maybe Russian?"

LOL!)I will add some cream cheese to the frosting.  \r\nMmmmmm Banana cake with cream cheese frosting.  \r\nThank you for the excellent recipe Lennie.  I can't believe no one has made this before.

The coconut extract is just what the recipe needs to give it the coconut flavor; not just the coconut texture with a bit of flavor.  I absolutely loved the idea of the syrup on the cake rather than a glaze.  At first I thought it would make the cake very sweet but the syrup on the cake is actually less sweet than a glaze.  The syrup adds to the moistness of the cake and provides a different twist from a traditional glaze.\r\nI used butter rather than oleo just because I prefer to bake with butter and did not use the rum extract because I didn't have any on hand(also not a big rum fan so I'm not sure if I'd like it).  The one thing I needed was a pastry brush to brush on the glaze.  It was a little difficult trying to drizzle it to get the same effect as a brush.  The recipe doesn't call for it but, I'm probably going to keep the cake in the refrigerator as the moistness may cause the cake to mold quickly.  This recipe is definitely a keeper!"

When removing the cake from the pan, the topping off this cake just ran down the drawers. I am feeling most bad because I was wanting to make this recipe since ages. "

I just got an email that my Junior's cheesecake recipe was just deleted off the site because there is a similar one listed....here it is.  I am sad to see you have not made it yourself.   I made this for Thanksgiving at my parents house last year.  The only other dessert that was touched out of 8 desserts was the pumpkin pie and that was by me, I had to have a slice...everyone else ate the cheesecake.  Everyone there begged me for the recipe.  Imagine that, a gaggle of jewish grandmothers asking the 29 year old tattooed mechanic how to make a cheesecake.\r\n\r\nThe most important part of this cheesecake is to let all the ingredients sit out to get to room temperature before you start.  This is VERY IMPORTANT.  Also, do not skip any ingredients if you do not have them (like cream of tartar)  It may not seem important, but the recipe is exact and the instructions are very clear.   I would recommend everyone go out and buy the Junior's cookbook.  "

The cake is moist and flavorful, and of course, the traditional german chocolate frosting is wonderful.  I liked the addition of chocolate chips to the top of the cake (some dropped and floated in the cake when baked) and on top of the frosting.  This cake looks very pretty with all the texture to the frosting and the chocolate chips sprinkled across the top.  The directions were easy to follow though I may have cooked my frosting longer than directed as I was afraid the frosting would be too thin.  I can't wait until I have an opportunity to bring a cake to something as I'd imagine this cake would go over very well (and quickly too).  Definetly a keeper!!"

First, in the cake I did 1/2 cup Irish Cream and 1/4 cup Irish Whiskey.  Second, for the glaze I did 1/8 cup Irish Whiskey and 1/8 cup Godiva Chocolate Liquer.  You really end up only using half the glaze.  Wow, this cake...it has now become my trademark! Thanks Recipenut!"

It will rise somewhat during baking, but dont panic (as i did), it will settle and be possibly the best cheesecake that you have ever had!!!!!!!!\r\n\r\nI wish that I could give it more than five stars."

At first i was going to make a cake from scratch but i ran out of time and ended up choosing this recipe.  This was EASY.  I dumped everything into the mixing bowl and with a hand mixer beat it for about 3 min.  I was not sure about the margarine, so i left it room temp. and cut it into squares so it would be easier to mix in but i did not melt it.  And i only added 1 oz. of red color and about 1/2 a bottle of .25 oz. red color (that was all i had) but the red color was intense just like it should be not pink.  Will also add some vanilla next time just b/c i love it.  Made this in a 13x9 and it took about 26 min. but my oven runs a little hot.  There were a few spots that were yellow where i think the margarine did not get mixed in but i don't think anyone noticed.  Frosted with store bought cream cheese frosting.  Beautiful, moist cake just love the deep red color.  And as simple as it was this will be my stand-by recipe for red velvet cake if i do not have the time to make one from scratch.  \r\nThank you AnnaCG =) "

I made this with the intention of using it as a base for other desserts calling for sliced pound cake, but this can stand on its own witha bit of powdered sugar dusted on top. I had no problems preparing this cake.  It makes a large cake and is very versatile - you can vary the flavor slightly by using a different flavor of yogurt.  I used vanilla this time.  It is easy to prepare and turned out great.  It is dense yet tastes light. Thanks! "

DH can't eat nuts, so I doubled the chocolate chips. Ghiradelli chips were on sale, and I will never use anything else - ever again! To be a bit less sinfull, we gobbled the cake down with low fat vanilla ice cream! Thanks, Karen for this heavenly recipe."

I thought Dick's Bakery in San Jose, CA had ruined all other Burnt Almond cakes for me so I was very surprised at how much I enjoyed this one.  I made it for dessert for Christmas and it was enjoyed by all...well, almost all.  A picky sister and a niece who'd rather have ice cream don't count!  Everyone else truly loved it.  I actually used both cakes and just doubled the custard (which was excellent, by the way!).  This cake does take a bit of time to prepare because everything must cool first but it is not difficult with very easy-to-follow instructions.  I highly recommend for people to give this cake a try.

As a lover of rhubarb, I was drawn to this recipe as it wa similar to my own recipe but the jello and marshmellows were a new feature. I also tried it with sliced strawberries and it also was superb. Since rhubarb can be hard to obtain, this recipes adaptability to other fruits makes it a real plus in my book.  It does require a longer baking time than normal, about 70 minutes but I am at a very high altitude so watch carefully but plan on at least 45 minutes and keep checking."

I would even add a touch less of sugar next time too because the maple syrup works great! I will definitely make this again!"

The best sourdough pancakes I've ever tasted, and I used to live in Alaska.  I used all wholewheat pastry flour (Bob's Red Mill, a nice soft flour that's never dry or grainy).  My starter is also whole wheat.  I tried the no-soda option, with the ww flour, and it was a total success.  The batter is sheer pleasure to use; great texture, spreads nicely on the grill and holds its shape well. They brown beautifully and cook quickly, and are absolutely delicious. Thanks very much!"

The only thing missing to make this cake heavenly is chocolate, and I managed to remedy to situation for me by using a dark chocolate cake mix instead of a yellow cake mix.  Still used the vanilla pudding, and this came out great!  You do need to nuke the frosting to make it a little runny, the top of the cake is a bit moist and I don't think frosting would spread very well, especially when thickend by peanut butter.  Shae, thanks, this one is going to become a family favorite!"

When I made this cake the first time I used the graham cracker crust, before I added the butter to the crumbs I took my cinnamon shaker and I shook cinnamon into the crumbs 3 times worked it in the crumbs and then I shook it 3 more times and worked it in again then added the butter. I also added fresh sliced strawberries to this one also. The second time I made this recipe I also used the fresh strawberries in it,but this time when I  got ready to use cool whip I did a half and half. One side of the cake had strawberry  cool whip and the other half was french vanilla.So far they both have turned out winners.(Don't forget to wash and hulled your strawberries before slicing)."

(I made this as a part of the German Chocolate Cake recipe also posted by this chef).    Ok, my problem was this.  I wanted to make a 2 layer cake for the German Chocolate Cake version, so I doubled this recipe.  I thought something might be wrong when I poured the mix into the cake pans (large restaurant size pans)...there was so much...  Sure enough there was soon cake all over my oven -- another lesson learned, always put them on jelly roll pans with parchement.  I'm not really a baker so I don't know if this was a problem with my doubling, but I could easily have made a 3 layer cake with the amount of cake that was left on the oven floor.  Still I'll make this again, and I know because I know I'll be asked to. [Editor's Note: recipe edited as a result of this review 1/2/03]"

I experimented with the veggies I happened upon in my refrigerater: onions, mushrooms, spinach and red bell pepper. Not bad at all--the red pepper gave it a whole new flavor. I usually substitute tofu for the meat, but I didn't have any. I put in walnut pieces, which was delicious. P.S. don't try to saute the veggies unless you can find a way to make the final product not so dough-y"

The taste was an amazing difference!  Thanks!"

It is not overly chocolatey or sweet, which was perfect with the buttercream frosting I used.  I did not have a square pan, so I used a 9\" round pan and it took 30 minutes.  Very good recipe for a quick, snack cake!  Thanks :)  P.S.  I am posting a picture which I am sure will not do it justice, but you can still see it looks pretty tasty."

DH wasn't home and I wasn't sure when he would get home, so I did everything except fry the patties before hand.  Then when he arrived, I went ahead and fried the patties.  The next time I make these I will leave the water out as that made them to loose to form into patties.  I had to spoon them into the skillet and then kind of pat and spread them out.  They tasted great and the fish and potatoes did not over-power each other.  Thank you for sharing this recipe Chuck!!!"

From the shortcake to the whipped cream, every bite was a taste treat! This shortacke has a nice sweetness to it that other shortcakes seem to miss.  The strawberry filling w/ the added vanilla extract was sensational!  The whipping cream with the added, not only confectioner's sugar, but also sour cream  was incredible!  This is a dessert that would definitely be considered \"Company Worthy\" in my book!  Thank you so much PanNan, for bringing this wonderful recipe to Zaar!"

Such a versatile recipe and so easy to make.  I did add some vanilla and chopped nuts because it just seemed to call for it.  I am sure this will become one of my husband's hunting favorites too as they stay so moist for so long.  Many thanks!!"

It is best after it sits for a couple of days.  If you want to serve it on a Saturday, cook it on Thursday night.\r\n\r\nOne of the best things about this cake is that it is made with a cake mix and goes together in just a few minutes.  But don't tell anyone it is a mix, because they won't know if you don't tell!!!"

I would probably suggest starting w/less butter for the topping and gradually add more as needed for the correct consistency...mine came out a little too \"wet\" because I put it al in at once, then again, I also melted the butter, maybe that's what the problem was? The cake wasn't very thick either, maybe use a smaller pan next time so it's not so flat. But the taste was great, and I love the topping, kinda crunchy, I only had chopped walnuts."

The cupcakes fell after I took them out of the oven and they were a bit funny-looking, but they tasted very good. They really are just like chocolate angel food cake - wow! I will definitely be making these again. UPDATE: I did not know what was meant by \"sweetened cocoa powder\" so I just used regular unsweetened cocoa. As I said, they turned out great. I have since found out that it was supposed to be Quik or something similar. I thought they were sweet enough for my taste, so I will continue to use unsweetened cocoa in the future."

I made them for a Halloween morning meeting at work, and they received rave reviews from the whole crowd.  I forgot to add the nuts to the muffin mixture and did not realize my mistake until they were already in the muffin pans.  (Hey, it was 5:30 a.m. and I had not yet had my morning cup of tea!)  I quickly mixed up a crumb topping, added it to the top of the muffins after I had piped in the cream cheese, and baked the muffins as per the recipe.  (Crumb topping: 1/2 cup chopped pecans, 1/2 cup brown sugar, 1/4 cup flour, 1 teaspoon cinnamon mixed together with 2 tablespoons melted butter.) The topping was a great addition; I think I will continue to forget the nuts mixed into the muffin batter.  Oh, I also decreased the amount of baking powder in the recipe since it seemed excessive - I used about 3 teaspoons instead of 5 and the muffins were perfect.  If my baking powder had been fresher, I might have cut it down to 2 teaspoons.  Thanks for a great recipe.  I'l make these again and again!"

Thankfully the recipe made 4 cakes for me, and I have got 3 more which I will be brushing and brushing more brandy into it.

GONE!\"  *LOL*  \r\nThis cake is VERY good! I normally don't like homemade cakes... I prefer store mixes... I didn't have a mix on hand and I wanted cake for dessert. I hade every ingredient for this one. (And always do!!) This cake SMELLS SOOOO chocolatey... and the batter is sooooo chocolatey *LOL*  It's moist and wonderful!! \r\nYou could actually get away with NOT using frosting ... maybe a dusting of powdered sugar or something if even that.\r\nThanks for posting this one!!!

It is very easy to make and the flavor is scrumptious.  The one thing I did differently, was to divide the Streusel mix in half .. putting half in the middle (as per recipe) then the other half I sprinkled on top of the cake. I served it with a dollop of whipped cream.  This is a KEEPER.. thanks a bunch.  :)"

It IS best warm out of the oven, but still very, very good cold. Be careful to just lightly press the topping, otherwise it turns hard during baking (it's still yummy, though). Also, if you double the recipe (in 9x13 pan), you do NOT need to increase the cooking time -- I cooked 50 min & it browned too much on the bottom. Next time I doubled it, I cooked it 40 min and it was fine.  Thanks for sharing this!"

Made this exactly as stated except had to unexpectedly run out after the frosting was made, so I had it in the frig a lot longer than 15 minutes.  When I got back it had hardened, so I microwaved it just long enough to soften to frosting consistency.  I also used the 2 extra T.'s of cornstarch for the filling to make it more pudding-like.   "

I am a chocholic, but I doubt I will have any chocolate cravings for at least a month. I served the cake with coffee ice cream on top and poured some of the sauce over the whole thing. My two year old proclaimed me the bestest cook, so thanks for the recipe. I did omit the egg, (my son has an egg allergy) and I read the recipe wrong and did not add the brown sugar at the end, just the remaining granulated sugar. Regardless, they have already begged me to make it again. While I did not have much left to put away, it did taste good reheated too!"

I chose to make muffins and they puffed up so huge and lovely - so chock full of dark navy blue steaks of blueberries - really, I can see why she calls this \"Blue\" berry cake!  These looked just like coffeehouse muffins but tasted much better.  Note: Make sure you grease & flour the muffin tins very well - including the top of the pan, as the when making muffins, the tops grow over the sides a big (to create that great coffehouse look)and they can be tricky to remove.  I let mine cool 30 minutes before attempting to retireve them from the pan and then gently loosened the tops and sides with a butter knife.  One for the permanent recipe file at home for sure."

My aunt brought me strawberry picking over the weekend and I made her this cake as a thank-you gift. She loved it! The cake was moist and smells SOOoo GOOD when baking! I bake about twice a year and never with much success, but this was really easy. Actually I don't even have an eletric mixer, but with the help of BF, the result was still good. Midway through baking I found the cake was already browned but the cake's not done yet (must be because I have  small oven), so I cover the pan with aluminum foil and continue baking. It wasn't a problem. I omitted the syrup because I don't have it and becuase the strawberries were already very sweet. Thank you again for this great recipe, I am so glad my aunt loved it! :D!!"

I wasnt quite what size pan to use, so I used a premade graham cracker, it filled up 2 of them.  I also only had half a pint of whipping cream and it still turned out great.  The cheesecake kinda melts in your mouth.  I had a slice for breakfast today and now a slice for lunch!  Very yummy!"

I don't buy unsalted butter, so I used regular and left out the salt to compensate. I also used 2% milk because it was what I had. Possibly it would be even better with whole milk, but I didn't feel like running out for some.\r\n\r\nI mixed this with a hand held electric mixer because that is what I have, and you can use one as long as you are careful not to get too much dry material in the mixer at once. It probably takes a bit longer and you have to be careful not to overwork the mixer...\r\n\r\nThis recipe is beautiful, each layer rose high, perfectly evenly and browned to a lovely color. It took more like 35-40 minutes to cook it in my oven, but that might just be my oven.\r\n\r\nI used a chocolate icing with it, and it made a tall (puts the cake mixes to shame) pretty cake with a fine texture.\r\n\r\nI can easily see why it was selected!"

I could have made them a bit smaller and made 10-12 pancakes maybe. I'd say this recipe makes 4 servings (or serves 2-3 hungry people!). Good pancakes though."

Made the cake w/o the alcohol & it was very good.  I have a 10 1/2 inch cast iron skillet & after 35 minutes the toothpick was still wet so I baked it for about 10 or so more minutes.  A bit hard to flip the heavy skillet & watch out for hot caramel drippings! "

Made them for a b'day breakfast, simple and quick, ttly delish.  I added another 1.5 cups of strawberries and a touch of extra cinnamon.  You could even add different fruits when they are fresh & in season with an excellent pancake batter like this.  Served with Pure Maple Syrup & breakfast sausages, next time will add whipping cream as a garnish. Also made a batch of Honey Cinnamon Butter # 43768. This batter without all the x-tra treats would be an excellent pancake batter for everyday breakfasts.  Best homemade pancake batter I have ever tried. I had given up on homemade batters but this was perfect and I will use this one whenever I make pancakes !!!  Thanx for sharing a great treat !"

These were moist, tender and melt-in-your-mouth delicious!!!  The batter was a light orange color, but they cooked up a lovely harvest golden color.  I was already half-way through mixing them up when I realized that I'd used up all of my nutmeg this week and forgot to buy more when I got groceries Friday night, so I added a pinch of allspice instead (for anyone wondering, no, allspice is not a combination spice--it is in the pimento family, with a taste somewhat like that of cinnamon, nutmeg and cloves combined).  I also used a half teaspoon of cinnamon, but I think as much as we love cinnamon, I could have used up to a teaspoon and been fine.  We had these as a late brunch with smoked link sausages, orange juice, milk and maple syrup.  I suspect they would also be good with sorghum.  love4culinary, thank you for sharing a winning pancake recipe.  Even DH says he definitely wants to have these again!"

Everyone couldn't stop raving over it!  I made only one change.  Since I didn't have light rum, I used gold rum.  I also baked it for an extra 15 min.  But the recipe is very easy to follow and turns out FANTASTIC!  So if you're a real fan of Pina Coladas, this is a MUST TRY recipe!  "

It is absolutely as light as you say it is, especially compared with other recipes I've seen on Rzaar - fluffy and golden, and so delicate and lovely a sponge (my first ever!).  I baked mine in a 22 cm round springform pan, and followed the directions exactly, except that I went a bit heavy on the vanilla and light on the sugar - personal taste only.  This cake will register as a recipe on my favourite list, I've fallen in love with it.  :) It helps that I've always loved milk, too.  Thank you for this recipe!  It goes without saying that I certainly intend to make this again, very soon :)"

One friend, who didn't know what was in the cake was saying, \"This is nice, but what's this flavor?\" It's almost elusive. Thank you for the wonderful recipe, Evelyn."

The cake itself is worthy of 5 stars on its own, but the dessert this divine tasting cake turns into once the lemon curd, raspberries, and thick gooey icing are added is spectacular.  The flavor is excellent and the instructions clear & accurate (although I added more lemon juice to my glaze as I prefer it thinner).  Note: I was unable to use an angel food cake pan this time, so after some research I found out that I could use two 9x5\" loaf pans (ungreased) instead and lowered the temp to 350F, placing them in the center of the oven - these changes were to accomodate the different size pans.  I had just a small amount of batter left over as a result.  This worked out just fine. Thanks for this 10 star recipe."

Since seeing that cake on tv, I have been wanting to make it.  You came through for me!!!!  It is such a hit at my house right now.  All 4 of my kids are filling their faces with it.  \r\nThe preparation was not as hard as I thought it would be.  I made the cakes a day in advance and then doubled the filling like you said.  I cut the cakes in half so that I would have the 6 layers.  I was afraid that the frosting would not cover the whole cake, but it certainly did. I assembled it all together and let it sit in the fridge overnight.  The thing weighs about 15 lbs.  \r\nI am in absolute heaven.  Thank you, thank you, thank you.....You are the best!!!!"

I would recommend flouring the pan after greasing it, simply because the sides of the cake became too crusty for my liking.  I also felt the temperature was a little too high as my cake started browning too early on the top - but every oven is different, so we must expect to make individual adjustments.  I covered the cake loosely after about 40 minutes and turned the oven down a fraction, and that did the trick. I chose not to make the icing and simply dusted powdered sugar over the top, merely becuase I was terrified of the calorie count, already, without it!! Thanks for a super recipe Chloe."

This cake is incredibly tasty - sweet and spicy (but not toooo spicy)!  I believe this cake could serve as an all-purpose cake: breakfast, snack or even as a delicious dessert.  I used the dark brown sugar, as you recommended - the sour cream, pecans and the optional cinnamon on top. Daydream, your cake is so versatile, it is my opinion you have made a MONKEE out of all other cakes! Thank you for sharing this wonderful recipe with all of us!"

The only thing I did different was add the zest of one lemon and use one cup of whole wheat flour with 1 cup of plain flour.

It took exactly 1 hour to bake. I made this as a special anniversary cake for my aunt and uncle (my dad's sister and her husband). I sent it with my dad to Mumbai and they had to cut it on 7th July, but ended up cutting it on June 30th itself!LOL. They said it was marvellous and was the center of attention at their anniversary party;)! I know they aren't kidding because I did taste on a few crumbs of this cake(and gave some to my mom n dad as well to test n see how it tasted). We all gave it an A+! I wish you all the luck in the world for this contest! This cake is a winner in my books! Thanks for an incredible recipe!"

I baked it in a 33x35 cm pan, so it was a bit bigger and flatter, and when I checked it at 50 minutes, it was almost overdone! I skipped the freezer trick as my freezer is quite simply so full that there was no room for the pan, and yes - it's probably the trick that makes the cake \"exceptionally moist\" . :-) My cake wasn't very moist, just wonderfully soft and fluffy and delicious! I was quite happy with it as I think there is such a thing as a cake that is too moist... but if very moist is what you prefer, try the freezer trick! I made the whole frosting recipe and it was just the right amount for my bigger version of the cake. I will certainly make this cake again! Thank you for sharing, Rhonda!"

The cake is lovely and moist and the crumble topping provides a wonderfully crunchy contrast. I only had medium sized eggs, but that didn't seem to be a problem. For the topping I mixed fine brown, muscovado and demerera sugar which has given it a great flavour. I also divided the dough between a 9x9 inch baking pan (to take to work for my colleague's birthday) and a small oval pan for me and my BF to share. I'll definitely be making this again.

Left out the cinnamon and walnuts, but will try the cinnamon next time as I love the cinnamon/chocolate combo.    I subbed lite sour cream and fat-free chocolate pudding, and it couldn't have been more delicious.  Left the cake in the pan, poked holes in it with a skewer, and poured the glaze on to soak into the cake before I turned it out onto a plate - definitely a delicious keeper recipe!"

I wanted to cut down on the butter so I used 3, rather than 6T of butter in the first step.  Other than that I didn't change anything.  There was plenty of butter in the finished product but I'm betting it wasn't as pretty as it would have been had I used more.  The brown sugar and butter didn't soak into the cake as much as it might have, resulting in a crust that covered the plums and blueberries.  Tasted great though."

I wanted to make a bundt cake, but most used cake mixes, which I didn't have, so this fit the need.  I also like it because it uses ingredients I almost always have onhand, and is quick and easy to put together.  I followed the directions completely, including the streusal filling,,,but not the chips.  The only change I might make to the cake is add a lite glaze, or serve with whip creme or ice cream.  That is my dh's idea,,,I think it's fine as is...very moist and rich.  I sat the baking timer for 60 minutes, but it was done in 38 min.,,,so you may need to adjust your baking time.  I think my bundt pan is larger than some.  I will be making this cake often, with and without the streusal.  We loved the moist, brownie like taste...sure to please a chocoholic :)..  Thanks, Carol!!"

Accurate measurements and clear instructions, as well as delicious results.  The pancakes alone are worth the full 5 stars.  Note:For the sauce, I only had pancake syrup on hand (no real maple syrup), so I tried it anyway and it was very good but far too sweet for our tastes. I did not deduct any points however, since I suspect that the pancake syrup is the culprit here.  So in case you were wondering if you could sub for the maple syrup, I would caution against it."

Not very tall, mine only came out to about 1 1/2 in. tall but then again I did mess up by confusing the two sugar amounts then my springform pan leaked half the water, but even with all that, it tasted perfect to me. This is one of the best apple cakes I've had so far. I'm sure if it's made correctly it'll come out even fluffier. Definetely best with whipped cream or ice cream. I will definately make this cake again."

Also, the fudge and caramel stick massively to the pan, so it is wise to totally line your pan with waxed paper, both the bottom and sides, before baking.  Freezing the cheesecake after cooling also helps in removal from the pan.  I have very expensive Kaiser pans, so the pan you use makes no difference--it will stick.  Those tips aside, the taste of this cheesecake is wonderful!  Everytime I have made it is has been given RAVES."

They were simple to prepare following the well-written directions, and the pancakes themselves were tender and reasonably fluffy. I would add more sugar next time, though, as I would have liked a tad more sweetness in them; I don't feel one tsp is enough in this batter, at least for my tastebuds. I also started off cooking these in butter, as directed, but did switch to canola oil as I found the butter was just burning too fast. My yield, by the way, was 11 pancakes. Thanks for posting this; I'll definitely make them again."

My oven needed a little closer to the 60 minutes recommended in the recipe.  Hubby ate 2 pieces tonight and has claimed the rest for the morning.  LOL  It is a winner."

I used Kitt's recipe #78579 to grease the pan & a long wooden skewer to make holes in the cake.  I also had a small lemon that was half zested & needed to be used up so I zested the other half into the batter.  My favorite part is how the butter sauce soaks into the cake & down around the sides, then as it cools it creates a slightly crunchy, candy-like taste & it is TDF.  We ate this warm before dinner last night & I just ate a piece cold this morning.  Still delicious!  Made in memory of John."

To say it went over well doesn't even begin to describe it. 7 people were sitting there with eyes rolled into the backs of their heads, saying, \"mmmmm, chocolate\". This cake was made exactly as written, and the only thing I would change, is a little less powdered sugar in the frosting (personal preference, everyone else loved it). I have to say this is one of the best chocolate cakes I've ever made. The texture was wonderful; dense and moist, full of flavor. There is one piece left and it's mine, all mine...."

It was quick and easy to put together and did not take very long to cook. The caramel icing is good also. It is the first time that I correctly made it. I substituted partially reconstitued evaporated milk for the milk in the caramel icing recipe. Instead of 1:1 ratio, I used a 1:4 ratio. I tastes wonderful and rich."

Maybe I did something wrong, but these came out almost more like crepes than the buttermilk panckes I'm used to (i.e. light and fluffy). The batter was very thin and didn't puff up like I thought it would. I offered to make them with chocolate chips or bananas, but no takers so we just had plain pancakes. DH had his with real maple syrup and lil' sis and I just had ours plain. They didn't seem like they needed any more butter with all of the butter in the batter and then being cooked in butter. This was better than the last pancake recipe I tried, but I'm starting to think I'm incapable of making normal, American pancakes from scratch."
