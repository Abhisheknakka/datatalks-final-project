The syrup adds to the moistness of the cake and provides a different twist from a traditional glaze.
I used butter rather than oleo just because I prefer to bake with butter and did not use the rum extract because I didn't have any on hand(also not a big rum fan so I'm not sure if I'd like it).  The one thing I needed was a pastry brush to brush on the glaze.  It was a little difficult trying to drizzle it to get the same effect as a brush.  The recipe doesn't call for it but, I'm probably going to keep the cake in the refrigerator as the moistness may cause the cake to mold quickly.

I dumped everything into the mixing bowl and with a hand mixer beat it for about 3 min.  I was not sure about the margarine, so i left it room temp. and cut it into squares so it would be easier to mix in but i did not melt it.  And i only added 1 oz. of red color and about 1/2 a bottle of .25 oz. red color (that was all i had) but the red color was intense just like it should be not pink.  Will also add some vanilla next time just b/c i love it.  Made this in a 13x9 and it took about 26 min. but my oven runs a little hot.  There were a few spots that were yellow where i think the margarine did not get mixed in but i don't think anyone noticed.  Frosted with store bought cream cheese frosting.

I made it for dessert for Christmas and it was enjoyed by all...well, almost all.  A picky sister and a niece who'd rather have ice cream don't count!  Everyone else truly loved it.  I actually used both cakes and just doubled the custard (which was excellent, by the way!).  This cake does take a bit of time to prepare because everything must cool first but it is not difficult with very easy-to-follow instructions.  I highly recommend for people to give this cake a try.
