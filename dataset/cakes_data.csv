The coconut extract is just what the recipe needs to give it the coconut flavor; not just the coconut texture with a bit of flavor.

The syrup adds to the moistness of the cake and provides a different twist from a traditional glaze.
I used butter rather than oleo just because I prefer to bake with butter and did not use the rum extract because I didn't have any on hand(also not a big rum fan so I'm not sure if I'd like it).  The one thing I needed was a pastry brush to brush on the glaze.  It was a little difficult trying to drizzle it to get the same effect as a brush.

At first i was going to make a cake from scratch but i ran out of time and ended up choosing this recipe.  This was EASY.  I dumped everything into the mixing bowl and with a hand mixer beat it for about 3 min.  I was not sure about the margarine, so i left it room temp. and cut it into squares so it would be easier to mix in but i did not melt it.  And i only added 1 oz. of red color and about 1/2 a bottle of .25 oz. red color (that was all i had) but the red color was intense just like it should be not pink.  Will also add some vanilla next time just b/c i love it.  Made this in a 13x9 and it took about 26 min. but my oven runs a little hot.  There were a few spots that were yellow where i think the margarine did not get mixed in but i don't think anyone noticed.  Frosted with store bought cream cheese frosting.
